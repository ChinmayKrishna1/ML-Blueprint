# Linear Regression Tutorial: Housing Price Prediction

## Purpose
This notebook serves as an educational resource and reference implementation for those learning Linear Regression. It's designed to be straightforward and accessible for beginners who want to understand how to implement basic machine learning pipelines in Python. The goal is not to create the most accurate model, but to provide clear, reusable code that demonstrates core concepts.

## Dataset
The project uses the well-known housing dataset (likely the Ames Housing dataset) which contains various features related to residential properties, such as:
- Physical attributes (lot size, number of bedrooms, etc.)
- Location information (neighborhood, zoning)
- Quality ratings
- Building characteristics
- Sale information

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Loading the dataset using pandas
   - Setting display options to show all rows when needed
   - Exploring the dataset structure (81 columns initially)

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Identifying and handling missing values
   - Dropping columns with missing values (as a simplification strategy)
   - Converting categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding with drop_first parameter

3. **Model Building**
   - Splitting data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets
   - Creating a Linear Regression model
   - Training the model on the training dataset

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Calculating R² score (approximately 0.73)
   - Calculating Root Mean Squared Error (approximately $43,073)

## Results
The model achieved an R² score of 0.73, indicating that it explains about 73% of the variance in housing prices. The RMSE of approximately $43,073 represents the average error in price predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas: For data manipulation
- NumPy: For numerical operations
- Matplotlib: For visualization capabilities
- Scikit-learn: For model implementation and evaluation

## Limitations
- Simple handling of missing values (dropping columns)
- No feature engineering or selection
- No hyperparameter tuning
- No cross-validation

## Future Improvements
- Implement more sophisticated missing value imputation
- Feature engineering to create more predictive variables
- Try more complex models or ensemble methods
- Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation
