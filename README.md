# Machine Learning Algorithms Tutorial

This repository contains educational notebooks demonstrating various machine learning algorithms. Each implementation is designed to be clear, well-documented, and suitable for beginners who want to understand how different algorithms work in practice.

## Available Algorithms

### [Linear Regression](./Linear_Regression/)
- **Dataset**: Housing price dataset (train.csv, test.csv)
- **Task**: Predicting house prices based on various features
- **Key concepts**: Numerical prediction, feature encoding, model evaluation metrics (RÂ², RMSE)

### [Logistic Regression](./Logistic_Regression/)
- **Dataset**: Obesity classification dataset
- **Task**: Classifying obesity levels based on lifestyle factors
- **Key concepts**: Multi-class classification, categorical encoding, confusion matrix, classification metrics

## Purpose

These notebooks serve as learning resources and reference implementations for beginners in machine learning. They are deliberately kept simple to focus on fundamental concepts rather than advanced optimization techniques.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Each algorithm has its own directory with:
   - A Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) containing the implementation
   - A README.md file explaining the approach and concepts
   - The dataset files needed to run the notebook

2. You can use these notebooks to:
   - Learn how to implement common ML algorithms from scratch
   - Understand preprocessing techniques for different data types
   - See how to properly evaluate model performance
   - Use them as templates for your own machine learning projects

## Learning Path

For beginners, I recommend following this learning sequence:

1. Start with Linear Regression to understand basic regression concepts
2. Move to Logistic Regression to learn about classification problems
3. (Future additions will extend to more complex algorithms)
