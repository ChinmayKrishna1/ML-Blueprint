# Logistic Regression Tutorial: Obesity Classification

## Purpose
This notebook serves as an educational resource and reference implementation for those learning Logistic Regression. It's designed to be straightforward and accessible for beginners who want to understand how to implement basic classification pipelines in Python. The goal is to provide clear, reusable code that demonstrates core classification concepts through an obesity classification problem.

## Dataset
The project uses an obesity dataset ('ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_sinthetic.csv') which contains various features related to lifestyle, eating habits, and physical condition that may contribute to obesity levels. The target variable 'NObeyesdad' represents different obesity categories.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Loading the dataset using pandas
   - Initial exploration with head() function

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Checking for null values
   - Identifying and removing duplicate records
   - Categorizing features for appropriate encoding

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Applying Label Encoding for ordinal categorical variables ('CAEC', 'SCC', 'CALC', 'NObeyesdad')
   - Implementing One-Hot Encoding for nominal categorical variables ('Gender', 'family_history_with_overweight', 'FAVC', 'SMOKE', 'MTRANS')
   - Custom functions created for both encoding methods

4. **Model Building**
   - Splitting data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets
   - Standardizing features using StandardScaler
   - Creating a Logistic Regression model with increased max_iterations
   - Training the model on the standardized training data

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Generating classification report (precision, recall, f1-score)
   - Visualizing results with a confusion matrix

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas: For data manipulation
- NumPy: For numerical operations
- Seaborn & Matplotlib: For visualization capabilities
- Scikit-learn: For model implementation and evaluation
  - LogisticRegression
  - Label and One-Hot Encoding
  - StandardScaler
  - Classification metrics and visualization tools

## Key Features
- Comprehensive preprocessing with different encoding techniques
- Feature standardization for better model performance
- Clear visualization of classification results
- Well-documented encoding functions that can be reused

## Limitations
- No hyperparameter tuning
- No cross-validation implementation
- Limited exploration of feature importance
- No handling of class imbalance (if present)
